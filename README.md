# Landing-Page-Practice
Building a Landing Page for a Website to test my some CSS capacities

Basically I took a template from the Odin Project and am going to try to replicate something similar from the
ground up to practice some front-end skills. Will go on to link up an similar model with more things as I 
practice backend work a bit later.
